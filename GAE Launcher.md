Okay, let's go through the steps for using the GAE Launcher to run web applications again, making sure each action is clear and easy to follow.

**Goal:** To run a web application locally on your computer using the Google App Engine (GAE) Launcher (for older Python 2 applications).

**What you'll need:**

* A computer with internet access.
* Some basic ability to use your computer's file system (creating folders, finding files).

**Step 1: Download and Install Python 2.7 and the Google App Engine SDK** \[[00:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kPILMMe6EY&t=12)]

1.  **Open your web browser** (like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge).
2.  **In the address bar at the top, type the following search term and press Enter:**
    ```
    download Google App Engine SDK Python 2
    ```
3.  **Look for a link on the Google Cloud website** (it might have a URL like `cloud.google.com`). Click on that link.
4.  **Find the section for downloading the SDK for Python 2.** There will likely be different download options for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
5.  **Click the download button for your operating system.** This will download an installer file to your computer (it might be an `.exe` file on Windows, a `.dmg` file on macOS, or a `.tar.gz` file on Linux).
6.  **Once the download is complete, find the installer file on your computer** (it's usually in your "Downloads" folder).
7.  **Double-click the installer file to run it.**
8.  **Follow the on-screen instructions in the installer.** This will guide you through the process of installing the Google App Engine SDK and usually Python 2.7 if you don't have it already. Pay attention to where the software is being installed on your computer.
9.  **If the installer asks you to restart your computer, do so.**

**Step 2: Verify Python 2.7 Installation** \[[02:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kPILMMe6EY&t=125)]

1.  **Open the Command Prompt (on Windows):**
    * Click the Start button (usually in the bottom-left corner of your screen).
    * Type `cmd` and press Enter. A black window should appear.
2.  **Open the Terminal (on macOS):**
    * Click on the "Launchpad" icon in your Dock.
    * Type `terminal` in the search bar and press Enter. A window with a command line should appear.
3.  **In the Command Prompt or Terminal, type the following command and press Enter:**
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
4.  **Look at the line that appears after you press Enter.** It should start with `Python 2.7.` followed by some other numbers (like `2.7.9`, as mentioned in the video). If it shows a version that starts with `Python 3.`, then you might need to ensure Python 2.7 was installed correctly or temporarily manage your Python installations.

**Step 3: Find and Open the Google App Engine Launcher** \[[03:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kPILMMe6EY&t=183)]

1.  **On Windows:**
    * Click the Start button.
    * Type `Google App Engine Launcher`.
    * Click on the "Google App Engine Launcher" application in the search results to open it.
2.  **On macOS:**
    * Open the "Finder" application (the icon that looks like a smiling blue face in your Dock).
    * Click on "Applications" in the sidebar.
    * Scroll through the list of applications until you find "GoogleAppEngineLauncher."
    * Double-click on "GoogleAppEngineLauncher" to open it.
3.  **On Linux:** The method might vary depending on your Linux distribution. You can try searching in your applications menu for "Google App Engine Launcher." If you can't find it, you might need to run a command in the terminal to start it. Refer to the installation instructions for your specific Linux distribution.

**Step 4: Create an Empty Folder for Your Application** \[[03:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kPILMMe6EY&t=193)]

1.  **Go to your Desktop** (or any other place on your computer where you want to keep your project files).
2.  **Right-click** in an empty area on the Desktop.
3.  **In the menu that appears, hover over "New" (or a similar option).**
4.  **Click on "Folder."** A new folder with a temporary name (like "New Folder") will appear.
5.  **Type a simple name for this folder,** for example, `my-web-app` or `ABC` (as in the video), and press Enter. This empty folder will represent your web application.

**Step 5: Create a New Application in the GAE Launcher** \[[03:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kPILMMe6EY&t=211)]

1.  **Open the Google App Engine Launcher** (if it's not already open).
2.  **Look for a button that says "Create New Application..."** It might also have a plus sign (+) icon. Click this button.
3.  **A new window or dialog box will appear.** You will need to fill in some information:
    * **Application Name:** Choose a name for your application. This is usually used internally by Google App Engine. You can type something like `my-first-app`.
    * **Path:** Click the "Browse..." button next to the "Path" field. A file browser window will open.
    * **Navigate to the empty folder you created in Step 4** (e.g., the `my-web-app` folder on your Desktop).
    * **Select the folder** and click "OK" or "Choose." The path to your empty folder should now be in the "Path" field.
4.  **Click the "Create" button** in the "Create New Application" window.

**Step 6: Run Your Application** \[[03:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kPILMMe6EY&t=232)]

1.  **In the main window of the Google App Engine Launcher, you should now see your application listed.** It will probably have a status of "Stopped."
2.  **Click on the name of your application in the list to select it.**
3.  **Look for a button that says "Run"** (it might have a play icon ▶️). Click this button.
4.  **The status of your application in the list should change to "Running."** You might also see some messages appear in the "Console" tab at the bottom of the launcher window.

**Step 7: Access Your Application in Your Web Browser** \[[04:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kPILMMe6EY&t=243)]

1.  **Look at the Google App Engine Launcher window again.** In the main application list, next to your application's name, you should see an address (URL) that starts with `http://localhost:` followed by a number (the port number). It might be `http://localhost:8080` or something similar. The video mentions `localhost:13081` as an example.
2.  **Open your web browser** (like Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
3.  **In the address bar at the top of the browser, carefully type the address you saw in the GAE Launcher** (including `http://`). For example, if the launcher shows `http://localhost:8080`, type exactly that.
4.  **Press Enter.**
5.  **You should now see the output of your web application in your browser.** Since you started with an empty folder, you might see a basic directory listing or an error message. To see a real web page, you would need to add your web application's files (like HTML files, Python code, and an `app.yaml` configuration file) inside the folder you created in Step 4 *before* running the application.

**Important Reminder:** This process uses the older Python 2 version of Google App Engine. For new web applications, you would typically use Python 3 and a different deployment process using the Google Cloud CLI. This method is mainly for running or working with older applications built for the Python 2 environment.
