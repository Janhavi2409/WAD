Here are the steps on how to launch an instance (virtual machine) in Openstack, as described in the video:

* First, log into your Openstack platform using your normal user ID \[[00:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsn2e2fvLQ&t=23)\].
* In the overview section, click on "Launch Instance" \[[00:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsn2e2fvLQ&t=43)\].
* Choose the desired image, for example, Fedora 32 image \[[01:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsn2e2fvLQ&t=63)\].
* Select a flavor for the instance, which defines the resources allocated to it \[[01:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsn2e2fvLQ&t=105)\].
* Configure the network settings, including selecting the appropriate network \[[02:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsn2e2fvLQ&t=130)\].
* Add a security group to define the firewall rules for the instance \[[02:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsn2e2fvLQ&t=147)\].
* Review the configuration and click "Launch Instance" to start the process \[[02:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsn2e2fvLQ&t=170)\].
* Once the instance is launched, you can access it via the console or through SSH, if configured \[[03:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsn2e2fvLQ&t=201)\].
* To access the instance from outside the network, you may need to associate a floating IP address with it \[[05:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsn2e2fvLQ&t=338)\].
* You can view the instance logs and access the console from the Openstack dashboard \[[04:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsn2e2fvLQ&t=281)\].
